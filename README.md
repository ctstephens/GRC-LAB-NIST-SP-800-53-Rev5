  (https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/downloads)
![NIST 800-53 spreadsheet download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d62d81a-8411-419b-8ddc-c3a86bf532f5)


- IDENTIFY WHO WE NEED TO TALK TO AND WHAT WE NEED TO SEE?
  For this I Mock interviewed the CISO & IT Manager of a Dummy Company.
- UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO ASK ( CONTROLS CAN BE REWRITTENEN/REPHRASED USING USING CHAT GPT AS AN EXAMPLE )
  For this Lab I used Least Priviledge Controls for the Compliance Audit and Risk Assesment.

### AUDIT LOGISTICS
_______________

- WHO DO YOU NEED TO TALK TO? SCHEDULE MEETING? HOW LONG IS NEEDED FOR MEETING?
  This can be done prior with say a liason of the Organisation to save time when you actually perform the Audit.
- REQUESTING SOP'S/POLICIES ( DOCUMENTATION )

### AUDIT ( ON-SITE OR REMOTELY )
_____________________________

- HIGH IMPACT OF AUDIT; RESPECT TIME GIVEN/PROVIDED FOR AUDIT WITH THE ORGANISATION/PERSONS BEING INTERVIEWED.
  I Interviewed the CISO (Chief Information Security Oficer) and IT Manager asking about the Least Privilege Controls being used in their Organisation.
